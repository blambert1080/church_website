# Welcome

The members of the Twin Creeks church of Christ invite you to join us. We seek to follow His word for all that we believe and practice--doing Bible things in Bible ways. Come on in and learn more about Jesus and what the Twin Creeks church is doing to serve Him.

## Assembly Information

Face coverings and masks are optional while walking around the building and while you are seated. 

The blue chairs in the back of the auditorium as well as the West nursery will be designated mask required zones.
